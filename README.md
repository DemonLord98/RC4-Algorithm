# RC4 Algorithm
A simple RC4 cipher program written in Python.
### How the program works
The program currently works by recieving the text to be encoded and the key both in the form of a UTF-8 string, then convert them to integers to work with them mathematically, and finally output the ciphered text in the form of hexadecimal numbers.
### TODO
- [x] Create a decrypting method
- [ ] Enable Hex inputs
- [ ] let the user choose to decrypt or to encrypt
